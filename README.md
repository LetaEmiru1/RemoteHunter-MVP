## üöÄ About This Project

RemoteHunter is a full-stack web application designed to automate the search for remote job opportunities. As my first end-to-end project, it was built to solve a personal challenge: breaking out of "tutorial hell" and creating a complete, functional, and deployed product from scratch.

The application automatically fetches new remote job listings, stores them, and allows users to register for personalized daily email alerts based on a specific keyword, all while operating at zero financial cost.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Public Job Board:** A clean, responsive interface displaying the latest remote job listings.

## üìà What I Learned

Building RemoteHunter was an incredible learning experience. I went from understanding language syntax to architecting a full-stack system. Key takeaways include:
*   Designing a relational database schema and implementing server-side SQL triggers.
*   Building a secure, decoupled frontend/backend architecture.
*   Managing secret keys and credentials securely using environment variables.
*   Automating a complete data pipeline using GitHub Actions for a true "set it and forget it" application.
